# PushT Task with MuJoCo
**Part of the [MujocoAR](https://github.com/omarrayyann/MujocoAR) package demo, which can be installed using ```pip install mujoco_ar```**

A MuJoCo environment (```scene.xml```) simulation of a pushT task, a common benchmark for testing behaviors multimodality. The robot's goal is to push a "T" shaped object to a target location. The simulation includes an operational space controller to handle the movement of a KUKA-iiwa14 arm with a stick tool at the end.
